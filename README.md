# Handwriten digit classifier with Neural Network
This project is made to get better understanding on Neural Networks.
The project trains on 20*20 grayscale handwriten digits with manually given parameters(iteration numbers,regularization parameter,etc)
Then you can see the accuracy on the same training set.

The project based on the Machine learning Course By Andrew Ng,Stanford University(https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)
